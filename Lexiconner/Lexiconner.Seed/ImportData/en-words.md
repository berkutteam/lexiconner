Rules:
Document is in markdown format.
Each peace of data (field) is in a new line.
Basic structure for a particular word:

*** (3 asterisks)
<Word or phrase>
<Translation>
<Example 1>
<Example 2>
...
<Example n>
--- (3 hyphens)

Different translations separated with ', <space>'
E.g.: Закапывать, хоронить

Different parts of speach are separated with '<space>/<space>'
E.g.: Отшельник / отшельнечиский, уедененный

Each line with text could end with dot '.' symbol, but not necessarily.

In collocations words like somebody, something, etc. can be replaced with <somebody>, <something>, etc. That should help to parse and view that more user friendly.
E.g.: Bleed <somebody> dry
